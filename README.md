Specifically designed for lung X-ray images on “Normal” and “Covid” classes 
while training and ”Normal” and ”Pneumonia” classes when testing, our innovative 
Cross-Domain Few Shot Image Classification model integrates Prototypical Networks 
with a ResNet12 backbone. In the 10-shot scenario, the model achieves notable 
results with 90.91% accuracy, 90.0% sensitivity, and 91.84% specificity.
